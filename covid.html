   	<h4>what is a corona virus/Covid-19</h4>
     <p>Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness
        in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known
        to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
        severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
        and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently
        discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. </p>
        <h4>what is Covid-19</h4>
        <p>
           COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently
           discovered corona virus. This new virus and disease were unknown
           before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. 
        </p>
        <h4>What are the symptoms of COVID-19</h4>
        <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
           dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
           congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
           usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
           don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people
           (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special
           treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19
           becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people,
           and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure,
           heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
           People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical
           attention. </p>
        <h4>How does COVID-19 spread</h4>
        <p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
            disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
             the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
            coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces
            around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching
            these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
            People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a
            person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is
            why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a
            person who is sick</p>
        <h4>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?</h4>
        <p>Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is  mainly
          transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than
            through the air. See previous answer on “How does COVID-19
           spread?” </p>
        <h4>Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms? </h4>
        <p>The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets
           expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19
           from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many
           people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is
           particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore
           possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just
           a mild cough and does not feel ill. 
         </p>
        <h4>What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of
          disease</h4>
        <p>Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak,
           available on the national,state and local public health authority. Many
           countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several
           have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries
           have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the
           situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.
           You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID19 by taking some simple precautions: 
            <ul>
            	<li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcoholbased hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
                Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using
                alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.</li>
            	<li>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and
                anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
                Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid
                droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you
                are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the
                COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. 
                </li>
            	<li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
                   Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses.
                   Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes,
                   nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and
                   can make you sick. 
                 </li>
            	 <li>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good
                    respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose
                    with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then 
                    dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory
                    hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as
                    cold, flu and COVID-19 </li>
            	  <li>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough  and
                  difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.
                  Follow the directions of your local health authority.
                  Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date
                  information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will
                  allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right
                  health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread
                  of viruses and other infections</li>
            	  <li>Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local
                  areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid
                  traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or
                  have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
                  Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of
                  these areas.</li>
            	
            	<li></li>
            </ul>

            </p>
        <h4>Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past
         14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading 
         </h4>
        <p>
        	<ul>
                <li>Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for
               everyone) </li>
                <li>Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even
                with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C
                or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is
                essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go
                out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other
                people.
                Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities
                will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help
                protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other
                viruses</li>
                <li>If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek
                medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory
                infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your
                provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers.
                Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to
                quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to
                prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses. </li>
        	</ul>
           
        </p>
        <h4>How likely am I to get infected with COVID-19?</h4>
        <p>The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether
            there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.
            For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is
            still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or
            areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting,
            these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments
            and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new
            case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local
            restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with
            disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading
            COVID-19.COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as
            has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately,
            new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the
            situation where you are or intend to go. </p>
        <h4>Who is at risk of developing severe illness</h4>
        <p>While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people,
           older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such
           as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or
           diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others. </p>
        <h4>Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?</h4>
        <p>No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on
           bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do
           not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or
           treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a
           physician to treat a bacterial infection. </p>
           <h4>Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure
             COVID-19</h4>
           <p>While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide
              comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, these remedies include the Madagascar Herbal medicine which at the end didn't reach clinical trial. there is no evidence
              that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. We does not
              recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, 
              as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several
              ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional
              medicines. We will continue to provide updated information as soon
              as clinical findings are available, so far as invention is taking place, Russia happened to be the first country to announced the vaccine while some other countries like India and China plus USA have also shown great hope that there will be vaccine soon as both countries completed phase III of the invention</p>
           <h4>Is there a vaccine drug or treatment for COVID-19</h4>
           <p>Yes. there is hope that the vaccine will reach everyone as Russia announced the development of vaccine recently. many other countries such as India and China are in phase III of the vaccine which is likely to be aveiled soon for use. But still the vaccine have not reach other parts of the world, therefore we can still say there is not vaccine yet and that people still need to be abid by their governments rules and regulations
             to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should
             receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should
             be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under
             investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials.
             The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against
             COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with
             the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1
            meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing 
          </p>
           <h4>Should I wear mask to protect myself</h4>
           <p>Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially
              coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.
              Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or
              looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is
              a world-wide shortage of masks, so We urge people to use masks
              wisely. We advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary
              wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks The most
              effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to
              frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow
              or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from
              people who are coughing or sneezing.</p>
           <h4>How to put on use take off and dispose of a mask?</h4>
           <p>
              <ol>
                <li> Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers,
                and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough</li>
                <li>Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based
                hand rub or soap and water</li>
                <li>Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes</li>
                <li>Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes</li>
                <li> Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the
                    coloured side).</li>
                <li>Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of
                the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose</li>
                <li>Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your
                chin.</li>
                <li> After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from
                behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face
                and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces
                of the mask.</li>
                <li>Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use. </li>
                <li>Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the
                   mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash
                   your hands with soap and water</li>
              </ol>
           </p>
           <h4>Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?</h4>
           <p>While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong
           Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can
           transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets
            produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To
           protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly.
            We continues to monitor the latest research on this and other COVID19 topics and will update as new findings are available. </p>
           <h4>How long does the virus survive on surfaces?</h4>
           <p>It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on
            surfaces, but it seems to behave like other corona viruses. Studies
            suggest that corona viruses (including preliminary information on the
            COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to
            several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of
            surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).
            If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant
            to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with 
            an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid
            touching your eyes, mouth, or nose</p>
           <h4>Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal
           source?</h4>
           <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in
             animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which 
             may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was
             associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by
             dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not
             yet been confirmed.
             To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid
             direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals.
             Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk
             or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods

           <h4>How long is the incubation period for COVID-19?</h4>
           <p>The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus
            and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of
            the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most
            commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more
            data become available. </p>
    <p><em><b>In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing
       seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more
        severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with
        your health care provider.</b><em></p>
