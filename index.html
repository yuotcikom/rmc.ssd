              <p>When we think about software, we rarely think about the technology as a standalone sector. Instead, we think about the role it plays in our economy and society. Developers and designers create the products, but it is the job of sales and marketing professionals to sell the benefits - and the services - into target sectors and markets. There are software products and solutions for nearly every sector. Software that improves Human Resource (HR) and recruitment processes. Software as a Service (SaaS) - the most popular form of pricing and delivering technology services - products are playing key roles in the healthcare, health and safety, marketing, retail, travel, property, advertising sectors, and dozens of other markets. It is the role of sales teams to bring these products to market, win customers, and grow market share within the sector the product is designed to serve. In this series of articles, and supporting eBook, we will walk you through how to sell software, how to increase sales and how to manage the sales pipeline and process to close deals faster. for more about software sales, please <a href="software.html">click here.</a></p>
